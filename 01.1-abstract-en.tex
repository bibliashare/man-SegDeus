\begin{abstract}
    This study begins by proposing \emph{definitions} for eschatologies (i)~``created according to God,  in  true  righteousness
    and holiness,'' and the ones (ii)~``in error,'' which, together, contain  all  eschatologies  ---  such  concepts  are  made
    general, in the Appendix, for \emph{any biblical doctrine}. It proceeds by proposing the  identification  and  statement  of
    \emph{biblical principles} that are necessarily at work in eschatologies ``created according to God,'' but by themselves are
    not guarantees. Such principles can be employed in \emph{definitive proof}  of  error  occurrences  in  eschatologies  under
    analysis. The study proceeds with identifying 9 (nine) such principles, from Scriptures, under the  axioms  that  Scriptures
    are true and are the Word of the only existing God. Some immediate implications are discussed. For the glory of God,  it  is
    hoped that the approach and concepts of this study contribute to the unification  of  biblical  eschatology  \bQuote{created
    according to God, in true righteousness and holiness} Ef~4.24 (NKJV).
